It will also store all previous results, however on refresh will only display 4 and a clear button which will clear out any previous results and refresh page in order to have fresh results.

 User Inputs Location in Search Bar

 If there is no result user is presented with an error message, if Weather API servers are for some reason down user is also presented with another error message stating so.

 User is returned with the day of weather as well as 5 day forecast.

 In the "that day" section the user is presented with City name, date, and an image showing conditions. In the same are other information includes Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and UV Index.

 Below that in the 5-Day Forecast are 5 blue boxes that include date, image representation of weather, temperature, and humidity.
